Hi Guddu,

Can you share your GitHub repo. For GitHub pages question.

Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.

Try adding CORS to your code it might work.

Kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

Please use triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.

eg
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
       print ("Hello")
    

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.

Thanks and kind regards

**Jivraj**  
*2025-01-14T10:30:40.928Z*


Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.

kind regards

Hi Guddu,

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

kind regards.

[The image displays a Docker Desktop error message indicating an unexpected problem while executing a WSL command, suggesting solutions like shutting down WSL, rebooting, or reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop, and mentioning the error specifically occurs when deploying the "docker-desktop" WSL distro because "WSL2 is not supported."Docker Desktop Error558×377 27 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/7/d7bcf7a2f709561b98fa8bde031ab5d1e81a4a0d.png "Docker Desktop Error")

Hi Telvin,

Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

[@Nelson](/u/nelson) I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250 people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.




---
**s.anand**  
*2025-01-14T12:52:41.809Z*


[@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) in that case

  * a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
  * a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080



Please try one of these:

  * Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
  * GitHub codespaces, as [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) suggested



You _could_ try an ngrok alternative like [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll work.

If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is `class`  
In your screenshot, you are using `class_`  
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts `class_` as the parameter instead of `class` as required by the GA  
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter `class`

**carlton**  
*2025-01-16T08:27:32.543Z*


Hi Mishkat,

In your code, the word `class` is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing `class_` to `class` is not going to work. The _only_ thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api _not_ the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.

Kind regards

Hi Team ,

For GA - 2 , Question 6:

And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.

I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “*” for allowing request from any origin.

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Hi Tushar,

For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.

For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

i have added the header key in order to use the cors as said in the vercel doc but still i am getting that error.  
what to do?  
i have added the cors in the app.py file as well

[@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751)  
While I understand why you might choose to use `flask` due to your familiarity with it,  
the `http.server` library is just very simple to use.

The **only extra line of code** you would need inside your `get` request if you used the `http.server` library would be:

`self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")`

Try to rewrite your code using `http.server` library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a `get` request using the `http.server` library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.

Kind regards

[@23F300327](/u/23f300327) You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.

Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

Also the live sessions on [youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc) will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is [meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy](http://meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy)

[@23F300327](/u/23f300327)

Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.

When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api  
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.

The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.

That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this
    
    
    # api/index.py
    import json
    from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
    
    class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
        def do_GET(self):
            self.send_response(200)
            self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
            self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
            self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
            return
    

Notice there is no `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block.  
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.

`if __name__ == "__main__":` is used to execute some code **only** if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.

Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default `handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.

Another possible problem:  
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues [TDS > Development Tools > unicode](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode)

So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.

Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Kind regards

For example `https://tds21jan.vercel.app/`.

I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a `vercel.json` configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.

You can follow [Gui Bibeau’s guide](https://www.frontend-devops.com/blog/python-on-vercel) to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.

For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to [this guide on DEV Community](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-vercel-2o5k). I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

[The image shows an error message related to a FastAPI endpoint that's supposed to return student data based on class, where the expected response format of student objects (studentId and class) does not match the "undefined" response received, potentially indicating an issue with the API's data retrieval or response formatting.image602×222 67.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/c/fcd7353786e475229734f8def393d1cda2048b0b.png "image")

  
But when I run the url in my browser I got the following response  


[The image displays a JSON response from an API endpoint that retrieves a list of student records, each including a student ID and their class, with the query parameters seemingly filtering by multiple classes (6X, 5T, 78, and 2Z).image602×320 48 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/2/3275c782991af68b7160960aa59b153c8e3ee947.png "image")

  
I have checked both the expected result from the assignment and result from direct running of url both are same. I don’t find any difference.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) can you clarify where went wrong

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

  1. Open Squoosh and load the image
  2. In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
  3. The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes



[The image depicts a graphical user interface for image compression settings, showing options to resize, reduce the palette, and compress the image using OxiPNG, with an effort level set to 2 and resulting in a 63% reduction in size, totaling 1.41 kB.image398×570 17.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/c/0c8a9ea412f0d3bc7dd073bfb65399ff83e0c22e.png "image")

I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.

[@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)

Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

[ The graphic presents an educational overview of network ports, detailing common protocols such as FTP, SSH, and HTTP along with their corresponding port numbers, and features visuals of networking hardware like a server rack and a desktop computer to illustrate a networking environment. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2fT-g9PX9o)

[ The graphic illustrates the concept of a firewall protecting a computer from hackers and malware, visually represented by a hacker figure, a laptop, skull-and-crossbones icons representing threats, and a brick wall labeled "FIREWALL." ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDEX1HXybrU)

[ The image is a graphic comparing virtual machines (VMs) and containers, visually representing VMs with multiple servers running email, webserver, and database applications, and containers with applications in a server rack, indicating an animated comparison between the two technologies. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyNBf1sqdBQ)

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

Kind regards

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.

Can you clarify why this is happening?




---
**carlton**  
*2025-01-27T13:25:22.133Z*


because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.

Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”

Kind regards

hi [@23f2003853](/u/23f2003853)

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of `127.0.0.1`. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hi Shalini,

I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.

Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel, just check your code if it’s logically correct.

I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.

In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)

I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.  
Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

[@23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL](/u/23f3002987_j_sri_bal) ,

This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.

[The image shows a Vercel "Team Access Required" screen indicating that the user "jivraj-18" is signed in but cannot access the requested deployment URL because they are not a member of the team.image1822×874 43.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/6/f6ae861370f12370cde76d18de318ad1fc622d2d.png "image")

Solution :

Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.

[The screen capture depicts a Vercel deployment with a "Not Found" error message on the left, indicating an issue with accessing the specified URL, alongside deployment details on the right, showing the deployment ID, domain, status as "Ready," creation date, and source code access.image1709×787 66.9 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/a/ea1a1dadad49d6b6665a2366d0902d4a45122b32.png "image")

---
**Jivraj**  
*2025-01-30T22:10:20.492Z*


The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with `http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.  
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You _do not_ create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

@ carlton @ Jivraj  
Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.  
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.  
Do I need to do anything else ?  
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.  
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with `--n-gpu-layers 35` parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

Try these [@21f3000745](/u/21f3000745)

  1. Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.  
**If this doesn’t work, then:**
  2. Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
  3. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

yeah it worked. thankyou [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
actually on every reload of page , it generates new data which makes question so tedious.

Hi [@24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ](/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

For the **ngrok tunnel** question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to **keep all servers running** when clicking the **Save** button.

Also, I couldn’t find the **GitHub Pages URL** in your **GA2 response** , and many answers are unmarked. It seems you **didn’t click the Save button**.

Your current score is **4.5/10**.

I am facing several problems with the submission portal …

  1. In question no 5 I entered the answer 78918 It was correct , I submitted it after few hours when I reloaded the portal its showing incorrect … I tried to enter twice thrice also solved it again but no use…

  2. In question 10 I entered the required link it was correct after saving it and reloading the portal it shows incorrect …

  3. In question 9 I did all the necessary thing but the portal is showing couldn’t fetch … My system is able to fetch the data but the portal says “failed to fetch”

Hi [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573) ,

As error mentions to add tag to image.

Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.

For adding tag use  


[The image displays instructions on how to build, run, and deploy a container using podman, including logging into Docker Hub, building and running the container, pushing the container to Docker Hub, and adding a specific tag.image1351×578 40.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/b/7b580a40e755d3aab9c3b40941904405e516abf4.png "image")

Hi [@24f1002359](/u/24f1002359)

For **Question 10** , ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs** , double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9** , did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console** —if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

[The Chrome browser's developer console shows a CORS error when attempting to make an XMLHttpRequest to 'http://google.com/' from an origin of 'null', indicating the server does not provide the necessary 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header to allow the request.image724×136 18.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/2/329ce069447dd12d66391813c527d25c5d109b2f.png "image")

For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

Kind regards.

for question 9 u can use ,

`from fastapi import FastAPI, Query`

and

The image displays a Python code snippet, specifically a function definition annotated with FastAPI decorators and type hints, indicating an API endpoint named 'api' that accepts an optional list of strings as a query parameter, aliased as 'class'.

Hi [@24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ](/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a `.nojekyll` file in your root folder of your repository.

[The image shows a question about constructing a GitHub Pages URL, the user's attempt at constructing the URL, an error indicating the expected content was not found at that URL, the actual HTML content retrieved which displays "My Model Page", and a note about busting the cache if changes aren't reflected.image1900×809 131 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/4/64798b0686fda7cc36e604c3040f40e2872474b5.png "image")

I am facing this issue. It is stating the error as mentioned  


[The image shows a question about how to handle a query parameter `class` in a FastAPI application, specifying that it should filter students by class and return them in the order they appear in the CSV file, along with an error response indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual student data when querying the API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.image1630×575 64 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a65a73e26776aa7f03943523ae128705930fa05e.png "image")

The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.
