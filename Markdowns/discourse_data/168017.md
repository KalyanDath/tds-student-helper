[The screenshot shows a student taking an online assessment titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation," with instructions emphasizing open resource usage, hackability, regular saving, and answer checking, along with the student's login information, a link to a discussion forum, and a history of their saved scores.Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.41.09 AM2940Ã—1912 443 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/9/e9585e072dfc3561e03c611c02e5b5e283f3f1be.png "Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.41.09 AM")

Is this something to worry about?

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that.

Kind regards
