# Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread

### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments

### Why? 

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

### Too many Questions for LLM 

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

### What We need from YOU 🫵🏽

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

### How?

  * If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
  * If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful 



### Where?

[github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project2-QuestionBank](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project2-QuestionBank/blob/main/README.md)

    # TDS-Project2-QuestionBank
    Question Bank for all TDS assignments
    
    # Requested format
    ## Student Assignments Directory Structure
    
    Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
    - A `.txt` file with the question statement.
    - A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.
    
    ### Example Directory Structure
    RollNo_12345/
    ├── Assignment_1/
    │   ├── Q1.txt    # Question for Q1
    │   ├── Q1.py     # Solution in Python
    │   ├── Q2.txt    # Question for Q2
    │   ├── Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash
    │   ├── Q3.txt    # Question for Q3
    │   ├── Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript
    ├── Assignment_2/

This time I’ll create a functioning script way before deadline for everyone to use .  
The image displays a pirate flag, specifically the jolly roger of the Straw Hat Pirates from the anime One Piece, featuring a skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat against a black background, waving in front of a blue sky with scattered clouds.
