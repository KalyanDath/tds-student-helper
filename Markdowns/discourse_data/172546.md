[The image displays an online end-term quiz about TDS (likely a data science related subject), where question one presents a student-ChatGPT discussion about calculating the distance between two locations using the Haversine formula, with the student seeking step-by-step guidance.Screenshot (883)1920×1080 368 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/c/ec056436956f57e59ec82e28ba057bcac702e5b9.png "Screenshot \(883\)")

  


[The image shows a student taking an online TDS (potentially "Tools in Data Science") exam with questions like calculating the distance between two points using the Haversine formula, as well as a ChatGPT explanation of how to apply the formula and the student asking if their radian conversions of latitude and longitude are correct.Screenshot (884)1920×1080 134 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/b/bbcfe87fc66baeed2b84b5fa886be843839c8f04.jpeg "Screenshot \(884\)")

  


[The presented material shows a quiz question concerning the calculation of the distance in meters between an Emergency Supply Center and the Eastview Medical Center using the Haversine formula, given their respective latitude and longitude coordinates.Screenshot (885)1920×1080 315 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/2/12e0850750ac2455a741c15bc7af8afb42e74fb8.png "Screenshot \(885\)")

  


[The image shows an online exam or practice question related to TDS, where the task is to determine which of four hospitals (North Hill, Eastview, Westbrook, Southend) is closest to an Emergency Supply Center given their latitude and longitude coordinates.Screenshot (886)1920×1080 308 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/b/dbc48b38657ebbba8ddaf78f346cba73b1d9b032.png "Screenshot \(886\)")

This question is in 2024 Dec22: IIT M FN EXAM QDD2  
Can anyone tell how to solve this?
