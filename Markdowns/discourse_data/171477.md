Mail I received Yesterday:  


[The document outlines prerequisites for Project 1, including having a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs with a specific command, and reports that the Docker image is present and public but the GitHub repository is not present and public, and the Dockerfile and MIT license are missing from the root of the GitHub repository.Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-01-071174×451 54.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/0/f001f7be7e533353ac4526f1cf9d82d4211ea6e1.png "Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-01-07")

Previous Correct Evaluation Mail:  


[The message informs a student that their Docker image submission has been evaluated, providing links to evaluation and Docker log files, along with several attached files related to server start, evaluation script, data generation, Docker orchestration, and a solution script, also mentioning that missing files will result in a score of zero, and offering an opportunity to report issues before the score is finalized.Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-02-351687×650 144 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/b/6bb4d7ba36bee2297d141e76bff49f40efe201ef.png "Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-02-35")

Good Morning Sir,

This is my github repo: [GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1](https://github.com/kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1) ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)

I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me. Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

Apologies for that,

The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.

Kind regards

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

  1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
  2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository



Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

[The email shows an evaluation of a student's Docker image submission for a project, providing links to evaluation and Docker log files, attachments for server start logs, evaluation scripts, data generation, Docker orchestration, and a solution script, and indicating a deadline to report any problems with the scores.First Evaluation Email1511×724 76.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/b/ab6e90977d3a9f6e9a01fd75e236dcbef7834623.png "First Evaluation Email")

  


[The email displays the results of a Project 1 prerequisite evaluation, indicating that while the Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public, the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are missing from the root of the GitHub repository, resulting in a failing grade and a project score of zero.Second Evaluation Email1247×681 37.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/6/e658099edcddd2b1b01d88e400b0f0439aa2fd2e.png "Second Evaluation Email")

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final)

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,

Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

You talking about me or [@23f2000345](/u/23f2000345) ?

Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?

My GitHub repository for Project-1: [GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds)

Thanking You

Just attaching the mail I recieved.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:

`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

> To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv. # /// script # dependencies = [ # "requests", # ] # /// import requests import datetime as dt import zoneinfo import argparse import os import zipfile parser = argparse.…

[URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/urgent-attn-req-technical-discrepancy-and-inconsistency-in-the-evaluation-scripts-of-graded-assignment-and-project-2/173172/32) [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds/blob/main/Dockerfile)) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation. Project 2 : Response we received through google form was <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api> which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
