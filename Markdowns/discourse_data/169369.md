Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?

Thank you

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.

We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.

Bottom line: wait till Tuesday  
Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.  
If not let us know

Kind regards.

Please clarify.
