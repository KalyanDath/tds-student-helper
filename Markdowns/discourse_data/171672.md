[The image shows the results of a pre-requisite evaluation for a coding project, indicating that while the Docker image, GitHub repo, and Dockerfile are present and public, the MIT license is missing from the root of the GitHub repository, leading to a failing grade for the project.Screenshot 2025-04-03 1613021268×533 16.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/d/dd486ca8bb6ad3279af98783a50cbc232f3fd8e6.png "Screenshot 2025-04-03 161302")

[The image shows a GitHub documentation page explaining how to add a license to a repository, guiding the user to enter "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.md" in the file name field and then click "Choose a license template."image1480×950 140 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/2/b2559e16f3dcfa20be7636f41868bec610f2ad1e.png "image")

I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as `Licenese.md` but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).

So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

[The image displays a commit history from a software repository, listing four commits with messages like "Rename License.md to LICENSE.md," "Update License.md," and "Update and rename README.md to License.md," all attributed to user "virajpitale" on different dates in February and April of 2025, with some commits marked as verified and showing abbreviated commit hashes.Screenshot 2025-04-07 1742561710×518 33 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/9/29a6882ebe14812a2abcbaa3dc18405d45ec6111.png "Screenshot 2025-04-07 174256")

  
I submitted the project **within the deadline** , and I ensured that **all requirements were fulfilled** , including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.

However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.

Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: [GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.

Thank you for your understanding.
