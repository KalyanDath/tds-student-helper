The deadlines mentioned in the Grading Document provided and the TDS website ([s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net)) are different. Project-1’s deadline was 15 Feb, it was then postponed to the 16th of Feb. Can this be reflected here?  
Not affecting me particularly, however, it’s good to be consistent across channels of communication to the students…

[The document outlines the grading structure for a "Tools in Data Science" course, detailing assessment components like a remote online exam (ROE1), take-home projects (P1, P2), and weekly assignments (GAA), including open dates, submission deadlines, and formulas for calculating the final course score with varying weights for each component and the final exam (F).grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_11.39.08_on__19-02-2025__0032971484×1168 161 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/6/d6f1b7044757c29a9ff64c6d9f38afcb1829c308.png "grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_11.39.08_on__19-02-2025__003297")
