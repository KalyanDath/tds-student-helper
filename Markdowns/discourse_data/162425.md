Hi Sahil,

Please find it at the following location.

[The image displays a course website's navigation menu listing topics within "Tools in Data Science" on the left, and on the right, it shows course links including "Course Links" and "Jan 2025 Links" with entries like "TDS: Course calendar - Jan 2025."Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 18.25.312474Ã—1306 330 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/6/b690d26af607c7a3a2af2f41a6e89d323ac7510c.png "Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 18.25.31")
