Sir,  
I haven’t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.  
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi [@Sakshi6479](/u/sakshi6479),

You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.

[The image describes an offer for IITM BS students to receive a bonus mark on a graded assignment by posting a relevant question or reply on the GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread (TDS Jan 2025) on Discourse.Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 11.02.31 am2566×224 23.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/2/3205507ea43e03c25e60cdefccf830d9e1a803ed.png "Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 11.02.31 am")

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.

That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.

Kind regards
