Please post any questions related to [Graded Assignment 6 - Data Analysis](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002?id=25&type=assignment&tab=courses&unitId=23)

The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. I’m unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify?

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
I have similar concern  
For Q1, I used the following code:
    
    
    print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
    kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
    for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
        pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
        print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')
    

And got the following output:
    
    
    Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
    	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
    	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
    	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04
    

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.  


[The image shows a multiple-choice question selection with "AvgDistance: -0.05" selected, suggesting a user is answering a question related to a model or dataset where features such as mileage, average distance, and engine capacity are being considered.image281×219 9.1 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fa9a2e601c94da84cbd25c406235d1009b204c.png "image")

Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:
    
    
    print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
    pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
    for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
        pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
        print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')
    

and got the following answers:
    
    
    Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
    	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
    	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
    	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08
    

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).  


[The image shows a multiple-choice selection list, where the option "'Mileage: 0.24'" is selected, and the other options are "'Mileage: 0.95'", "'AvgDistance: -0.06'", and "'EngineCapacity: -0.08'".image278×216 9.19 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/1/51b03d00c3e962e6c4fc7fc64930a23e82500006.png "image")

I used a python script to get the solution to quesiton 1 of week 6 graded assignment. It matches three options. Is this a bug or like we then need to analyze using the pearson coefficient to determine which option is the correct one

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Dear TDS Team,

There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:

  1. Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
  2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
  3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.



The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support.

Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.

For instance:

> forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.

but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
My question 7 for GA6 is :  
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance  
Whose options provided are :  
10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)

I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)  
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)

Hello Sir,

Can you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir we should select the absolute maximum value.  


[The image shows a multiple-choice question asking about the key factors influencing motorcycle resale value in Uttar Pradesh, specifically focusing on the impact of mileage, average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity on price retention for Royal Enfield, where the selected answer was incorrect and the correct answer is 'EngineCapacity: 0.09'.image978×393 23.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/4/b468c32e53fddf462c583b8664f183dd7afe37aa.png "image")

Example : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it’s absolut value is maximum.

For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows,  


[The image displays a correlation matrix showing the relationships between 'Mileage', 'Avg Daily Distance', 'Engine Capacity', and 'Price Retention', with values indicating positive or negative correlations and their strength.image748×431 17.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/5/c524c9f7645716e0fac9d8850df15c4c20af05dc.png "image")

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect

My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance

10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)

Also, my question 4 was :  
As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.

134483

94774

150666

199711

Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect

So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)

Kindly look into it

Thanks and Regards
