how to get the dummy API key?

**Jivraj**  
*2025-01-15T14:59:06.607Z*


Hi Nilay,

In order to make a api call to openai chat completions you are required to send authentication information(openai key) in headers. For first question of GA3 you don’t have to send actual(working) api key, any dummy api key would work(you can put your name, or tds anything works)

kind regards

Hi [@22f3001315](/u/22f3001315) ,

You are almost correct, there are very minor changes that needs to be made.

Take help from Chat GPT or use this documentation which have correct json body [Vision - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision).

Kind regards  
Jivraj

---
**23f2000237**

No, if you scroll down to the last question, we can get our Ai Proxy key

**carlton**  
*2025-01-21T12:06:09.235Z*


[@nilaychugh](/u/nilaychugh) [@22f3002034](/u/22f3002034)

The API key is available at <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/>

The instructions on how to use the token is given at [GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)

You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions.

You get a limit of $1. Use with care.

Kind regards

but the embedding model that is said to be used is text embedding 3 small, which is the model of OpenAI




---
**Jivraj**  
*2025-01-22T09:13:43.408Z*


Hi Nilay,

Yes you would need to use `text-embedding-3-small` model of openai for embedding questions.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, **is there any solution to this problem?**

Hi Nilay,

 nilaychugh:

> both the URLs use same port,

You can run two servers on different port numbers.

Hi Vikash,

I looked at your answers in backend. In answer you submitted response from openai, but you need to submit json object which is required for sending a request to LLM.

Kind regards




---
**Jivraj**  
*2025-01-23T11:07:22.861Z*


You made same mistake here, instead of response use json body that’s required for sending request to LLM.

Hi VIKASH,

This problem must be because CORS not enabled or you are running your application inside wsl, if you using WSL then you would need to identify ipaddress of WSL and use it in place of `127.0.0.1`

Hello Sir,

I am unable to recieve a proper output for q1 of ga3.  
This is my test message. Its been given in two lines.

The image displays a snippet of text, likely from a programming context or a forum post, containing seemingly random alphanumeric strings like "b7 rkS94mn4," "dNG4j EVevK24Ev," and "VEpiI G LeeHS," potentially representing variable names, IDs, or coded messages.

The below is my code for the question.
    
    
    import httpx
    
    url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
    
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer api_key",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    system_message = "Analyze the input message if it's  GOOD , BAD or NEUTRAL."
    user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4  AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"
    
    payload = {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": system_message},  # System message
            {"role": "user", "content": user_message}       # One user message
        ],
        "temperature": 0.7
    }
    
    response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    
    response.raise_for_status()
    
    result = response.json()
    
    for choice in result["choices"]:
        print("AI Response:", choice["message"]["content"])
    

I tried to put the two test lines as two user messages but received an error stating that the json body must contain only 2 messages with one mandatorily being a system message. With that in mind, i also tried the alternative

`user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4 \n AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"`

The error message i keep receiving is as below.

The code snippet shows the beginning of a "payload" object definition followed by an error message indicating that the user message must be a specific string, but it's not.

Kindly advice on how to proceed.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hi Shalini,

Your `user_message` is incorrect. I looked at your exact GA and it works if you make sure your `user_message` is precisely what is given to you.

Hint: How do you store a multi-line variable in python?

Kind regards

[The image shows part of an online assignment question asking the user to provide the correct JSON body for an OpenAI chat completion call, given the model to use (gpt-40-mini), system and user messages, and required structured outputs representing an array of US addresses with fields for apartment, zip, and latitude.image1920×1080 305 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/8/186f9bdca2765063fc8a6cfadc3e7b489543bfd4.png "image")

  
Like I literally showed this question to my mother and younger bro, stating the fact we ourselves had enable the answer box, they laughed there pants off…  
More courses could be like this.

**Q4**  
s3 string was given by
    
    
    image_b64 = ""
    import base64
    with open('/content/TDS_wk3_q4.png', 'rb') as f:
        binary_data = f.read()
        image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()
    data_uri = f"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}"
    

  
s4 string given by :   


used this [link ](https://www.base64-image.de/) to generate image url  
  
Then checked them both, they were the same
    
    
    for x,y in zip(s3,s4):
      if (x != y):
        print(x,y)
    

i verified that both were equal but still one gave the wrong answer(python code), while the online converter gave the right one?  
I know i’m missing something, but why?

Hi,

I’m sorry if I’m asking an unrelated question, But I’m very confused with the concept of generating the token from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>

Could any one suggest the step by step process? I couldn’t able to find that similar question asked by anyone since the conversations are vast.

Please guide me on this. Also do i need to use my personal mail id or iitm mail id for accessing this token

yes you have to use your IITM email id . Use this link and login you will get your token:

The error shows your code is getting wrong answers for the test cases. I looked into your code and noticed that you are using sklearn (I think which is not required in this case). Just get embedding vector for each document content and query by passing a valid POST request to <http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings> with required headers. And, then calculate `similarity_scores` simply using  
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}|}  
which in python syntax is-
    
    
    np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))

Sir, Regarding the embedding questions, I had posted earlier. Now, I am writing the error I faced. I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You  
The image shows an error message in JSON format indicating that the user has exceeded their current quota and should check their plan and billing details.

There are few more tokens for the user prompt, I think if you add 7 or 8 then you would get correct answer.

Other way to do this question is send a request to anand sir’s aiproxy and in response you will get number of input tokens.

I inspected the JavaScript code of this website, I saw that the answer took my input and added 7 to it, why is it programmed this way? Even if I were to use the AI proxy that was given shouldn’t the number of tokens remain unaffected?

**Jivraj**  
*2025-02-01T17:03:51.869Z*


When you send request to openai through anand sir’s proxy it takes some tokens for user prompt.

When you use tokenizer from openai’s webpage then it doesn’t take care of that.

Google Drive file.

* * *

For question 7

 Sakshi6479:

> 
>     import openai
>     

You won’t be able to send request through openai python module, here is one example how you would make a request
    
    
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}'
    }
    
    json_data = {
        'model':'gpt-4o-mini',
        'messages':[
            {
                'role':'user',
                'content':'What is 2+2?'
            }
        ]
    }
    r = httpx.post('http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions', headers = headers, json = json_data, timeout=10.0)
    

You would need to use professor Anand’s proxy or some other api key through which request can be made.  
Url’s for free api keys:

  1. [AI Proxy](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/)
  2. [OpenAI GPT-4o · GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4o/playground)



The way to use api’s is demonstrated in live sessions, also refer to this documentation [sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy).

* * *

For question 8, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s function calling feature and identify which function needs to be called and arguments to be used, we discussed in last Friday’s session on functions like `order` and `cancel_order`.

Kind regards

Hello sir,

While working on this question, I’m encountering this problem. It looks like the request is being made successfully (and I verified it by a POST request via Postman ), however while submitting my URL at the assignment portal, I’m getting an error.

[The image shows console output from a program interacting with a "similarity" endpoint, indicating successful collection resets, creation of new documents, addition of data to a database, a search query about internal cybersecurity training, and the matches found relating to employee training, staff handbook updates, and quality assurance testing protocols.image1550×207 22.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/6/b6feb2e4fd01c3630f5db6ee879eb4042b7cec09.png "image")

  


[The image shows an error message related to incorrect matches, likely caused by an incorrect API URL endpoint of 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity' entered by the user, in a context where the system is prompting for the correct API URL for a similarity implementation, alongside a notification about employee cybersecurity training and updated company policies.image1288×138 7.33 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/8/b81a8c44bd77972dadbeb69bb545ea7fe6c3203b.png "image")

I even tried deploying on a public URL using render. My guess is there is a formatting issue or it’s not sorting correctly based on the similarity score and not returning the top 3.

Would appreciate if I can get some clarity on the same

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { “matches” : [ “ABC”, “ABC”, “ABC”]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.

[The image depicts a Postman request to a local API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` with "No Auth" selected, and the JSON response body shows a "matches" list containing three strings: "FastAPI is great for APIs.", "Embedding models improve NLP.", and "Machine learning is evolving.", with a 200 OK status.Screenshot_20250204_032923991×615 43.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/4/14b928ed4ee1d76113b90069812abf2b53ab4ef1.png "Screenshot_20250204_032923")

I had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:
    
    
    class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
        docs: List[str]  # The list of documents to search through
        query: str       # The search query string
    
    class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
        matches: List[str]  # The list of matched documents
    
    .........
    
    @app.post("/similarity", response_model=SearchResponse)
    
    
    .........
    
    return SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])
    

It basically checks the Request and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that

{
      "matches": ["Contents of document 3", "Contents of document 1", "Contents of document 2"]
    }
    

Check if your response is in this format.

Does the final submission get graded, or is the highest-scoring submission considered?

I’m facing an issue where my score dropped from 8 to 6.5 when I checked all the answers one last time before submitting. I suspect the drop is due to the 3rd and 7th questions.

[The display shows a list of recent game saves, each with a "Reload" button, the date and time of the save (all from 2/5/2025), and a score associated with each save (6.5, 8, and 6.5 respectively).Screenshot 2025-02-06 001446810×296 14.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/0/b00269ee7b24a8f28c8ab53f4da556a11c8f3d27.png "Screenshot 2025-02-06 001446")

[The image shows instructions for an exam or quiz titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Language M," emphasizing the importance of regular saving, noting that the last saved submission will be evaluated, and permitting the use of any resources, including hacking.Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 11.27.07 am2570×1136 358 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/4/549b066a290c204c7468f501f107ef5eabe661f6.png "Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 11.27.07 am")

The score drops because some questions may require you to either keep a server turned on or some dynamic changes may occur for some questions (The dynamic changes are intentional in some questions, in order to get students to learn by doing. So if you solved everything and the score is the maximum… just make that your last submission. The score you see is the score you will get for your last submission).

If you want check a question without submitting. Then just use the check button instead. But your last submission is whats scored.

Getting the same issue -
    
    
    # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://promptfoo.dev/config-schema.json
    
    prompts:
      - |
        Generate a curl command to fetch ONLY the top 18 most-starred repositories
        from the "stripe" organization using the GitHub API.
        Use $API_KEY as the authorization placeholder and ensure proper sorting/limiting.

            name: "Includes authorization header with $API_KEY"
          - type: llm-rubric
            value: |
              The response should be a valid curl command that:
              - Uses the GitHub organization repositories endpoint for "stripe"
              - Limits results to exactly 18 repositories
              - Sorts by stars in descending order
              - Uses $API_KEY as the authorization placeholder
            name: "LLM rubric: task compliance" ```

**Realizing the Value of Collaboration**

As I’ve been going through this course, one thing that’s really started to make sense to me is how important collaboration is. None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine.

I’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.

This course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning.  
if somebody feels the same then Reply , Thankyou

For Question 3, I was able to enable the answer box but the answer is always saying that either it is not valid json format or Error: Model must be gpt-4o-mini, not undefined.

I have tried multiple approaches but the same issue even after using help from Chat GPT. Could any one tell what is the correct answer?? Thanks!

Here is my response for not valid json format error:

That’s true, that’s how real world works, working in silos doesn’t apply outside controlled environment. Pretty good course for the same purpose

For Questions 8 to 10 of GA3 how and where should we host the URL to receive and handle the responses effectively?

For qn 8-10, the API is working as expected locally, but I’m now unsure about how to **deploy** it in a way that allows you to send a POST request to a public URL.

Can someone tell me what was the output format of this question because i solved it and got the output which seemed correct enough to me but still got marked incorrect. Any help will be appreciated

One issue is there in
    
    
    "response_format": "json"  // incorrect 
    

Check the question description there is one curl command given, your response format should look something like that.
