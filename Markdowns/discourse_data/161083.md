[The image presents a question about manipulating filenames in Linux using bash commands, involving downloading a ZIP file, moving files, renaming them by incrementing digits, and then determining the output of a piped command sequence using `grep`, `sort`, and `sha256sum`.image1296×158 7.29 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f8af7c6e2fe001c8bf000605b52c903e1b0e6fe1.png "image")

  
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

*2025-01-05T05:50:28.537Z*


Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

Ok, thanks. I turned off many security features including anti-virus system’s security and windows security options etc. Then it allowed me to download uv on the system. Now it is running, and I got output as json for Q2.

2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.  
When I logged in today it says score is 0.  
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?  
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?  
If [seek] ([Nptel Seekh](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002)) can access [TDS exam] ([Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1)) then why we need to submit from seek?




---
**carlton**  
*2025-01-13T07:21:41.338Z*


The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to The image shows a bright blue button with rounded corners containing the word "Save" in white text, suggesting an action to store data or changes. the submissions to get a score for the GA.

The actual GA questions are on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> via the seek portal or  
on the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.

As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. 

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.  
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

**For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.**

Kind regards

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton).  
I answered questions on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.  
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)




---
**carlton**  
*2025-01-13T09:05:08.554Z*


Hi [@Nelson](/u/nelson)

Your answers on the [exam](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/) site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).

Kind regards




---
**carlton**  
*2025-01-13T09:26:22.507Z*


It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute `data-value`. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute `data-value`.

Kind regards

It gives the error:

Hi Shouvik,

Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.

Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

Try copy pasting exact symbols `— OR † OR €` Can you share code in code block, it’s difficult to read symbols that are present.

Also have a look at what `all_content` variable contains, see if there are some problem with content.

[@Rohitkumar7463](/u/rohitkumar7463) [@23f2003845](/u/23f2003845)

If you are on Windows Powershell  
Then instead of `sha256sum` you can simply use `Get-FileHash`

Send the output of the `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md` to a text file eg. `output.txt` and then use `Get-FileHash` on powershell with the `output.txt` and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.  
You might be able to pipe the data directly to `Get-FileHash` but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

[The image shows a screen displaying a recent game save from January 20, 2025 at 6:05:24 PM with a score of 10, along with the date and time of the current save.image742×336 21.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/1/b14fdd8db7fa7f4f811065f54b5b478db50f61ac.png "image")

But since you _already_ know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like `awk` (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.

7E…E5

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a _nearly_ unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

You need to submit whole json becausae In this image `headers` is part of response, not request headers.

Hi Arnav,

I tried your script on your dataset.  
Problem might be you are not executing `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in correct directory, you would need to execute it from `all_files` directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

Time of modification of each of these files is 14 Jan 2025 which might be the day you unzipped them. Depending upon what software you use it might change modification date while unzipping. use unzip command line tool or winrar extractor, these are 2 tools we have tested.

Hi Saravanan,

I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name `Bob`, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.

We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.

kind regards

I ran this directly in the console and got the correct answer.

// Select all

const fooElements = document.querySelectorAll(“div.foo, span.foo”);

// Initialize a variable to store the sum  
let sum = 0;

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

**Saransh_Saini**  
*2025-01-25T16:44:17.023Z*


Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

  1. Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
  2. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.




---
**21f3000745**

Hello Sir,  
I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.

I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of **80 out of 100**. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “**absent** ” for this particular assignment.

I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?
