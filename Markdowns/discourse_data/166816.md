[@24ds3000061](/u/24ds3000061) [@22f2001532](/u/22f2001532)

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

My week 1 score is showing absent in TDS from yesterday. Earlier it was showing 87.5 suddenly what happened I don’t understand its showing as absent… I have submitted my week 1 assignment before the deadline. Is it the same for every one or only for me… please some one clarify

because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,

[@23f2004320](/u/23f2004320)

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

Kind regards.

Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.  
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.
