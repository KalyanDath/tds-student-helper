Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?  


[The image displays two sets of data organized in a spreadsheet format, where each set describes PPI (Producer Price Index) industry data related to pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing, one for anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, and the other for calcium channel blockers, both indicating that the data is not seasonally adjusted.image1393×657 67.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a68861da691806bfec99dc5a1430e57440f508c6.png "image")

[The image presents question 7.1 of an assignment, where the student is asked to create a Google Sheet workbook named with their roll number, share it with a specific email address, and populate two sheets: the first containing data with columns for series ID, item, year, month, and value, and the second containing a pivot table with item as rows, and year and month as columns with a hierarchy and value as the values, to analyze pharmaceutical exports to the US.image1227×791 78.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/2/f29503cb82bdf0e5bfb45009597ef56609982c17.png "image")

Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.

@[Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/Jivraj)

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are  
The text describes the column headers present in a spreadsheet labeled "Sheet1," specifying that the columns include "Series ID," "Item," "Year," "Month," and "Value."

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”  
The image displays tabular data including the Series ID, Year, Period, Label, and Value for January 2023, with the value of 562.445 for Series ID PCU3254-3254-.

Item is there in other sheet we might have to join them to get items.

We have to extract all id’s and their respective item from other sheet and add in first sheet with respect to id’s .

Below items don’t have prices.

PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations  
---|---  
PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers  
PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts  
PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter  
PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids  
PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products  
PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors  
  
Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Can you please advise regarding the ga.7.2 as the The current top 5 countries by GDP in 2014 from the dataset are actually aggregated economic groups (not individual countries). can i proceed with that or I need to filter only the individual countries

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.

Kind regards

The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?  


[The image displays a Gmail inbox showing messages related to peer reviews for a course named TDS Jan 25, with emails containing attachments named with alphanumeric identifiers (e.g., "23f3003944.html") that appear to be individual peer evaluation forms.10000415651280×349 87.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/c/5c4178ae6580442d7ab92893ab19c065e7e9b672.jpeg "1000041565")

Hi Shambhavi, Thanks for the update. We will look into it.

Thanks once again

Sir,  
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.  
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
sir can you please clarify what do we have to write in google form if there is no submission?

**carlton**  
*2025-04-11T05:48:24.000Z*


You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
