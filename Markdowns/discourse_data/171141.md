Please post any discrepancies related to project1.

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

## Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?

All the image ids we evaluated were what _you_ submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos _you_ gave us.

For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

## How to fix bugs in our scripts

Create Pull requests to [Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1) .

### **Docker Image Architecture Issue Report**

If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:  
[Submit Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerCpqod-5ArJWTW_QW5PenyfZJHH_cmcUw3s8dAoG3zDZm8g/viewform?usp=sharing)

## Bug fixes

If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.

We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.

You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.

I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`.

This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389

[@carlton](/u/carlton) same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.

I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.  
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,  
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07

My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.

I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.

  * **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We _may_ pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.

Would you mind reviewing the evaluation.log screenshot I have attached? I believe I may deserve marks for Task B6. [@carlton](/u/carlton), could you kindly take a look?  


[The image shows a failed test case, likely from a web scraping or data processing script. The test, named "B6", compares an expected list of authors to a result obtained from a data file ("./data/b6.json"). The expected list contains the names "Albert Einstein", "J.K. Rowling", "Albert Einstein", "Jane Austen", "Marilyn Monroe", "Albert Einstein", "André Gide", "Thomas A. Edison", "Eleanor Roosevelt", and "Steve Martin". The actual result, in JSON format, also contains a list of author names, but it includes  "Andr\u00e9 Gide" (which looks like a unicode representation of the character 'é' in "André"), indicating a potential encoding or formatting issue. The test fails because the result list does not exactly match the expected list. The "HTTP 200" messages at the top suggests that the data file was successfully saved and retrieved.image1460×585 24.9 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/f/4f1dd8069b7f12f5d9d2005215621bc73be9a345.png "image")

The image shows a test case failure in extracting a credit card number from an image. The expected credit card number, "6011598665215965," doesn't match the extracted result, "6011598656215965," as highlighted by the red exclamation points. The task involves passing the image to a Large Language Model (LLM), extracting the card number, and saving it in a file. The HTTP requests indicate successful task execution, but a comparison reveals the incorrect result.image1451×640 64.9 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/b/fb3792e2a76ea8dd4cead0146f0366ceabc3dbb3.png "image")

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks **B7** , **B8** , and **B10** , the evaluation log does not include any **`POST` or `GET` request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.  


[Here's a breakdown of the image and its content:

**Overall Impression:** The image shows the output of a program or script, likely involving a series of HTTP requests and tasks.  Some tasks have passed, while others have failed, indicating errors in the process.

**Key Elements:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The log shows both POST and GET requests being made to a local server.
*   **Successful Task (B6):** One task has passed successfully, suggesting it was able to read data from the specified JSON file.
*   **Failing Tasks (B7, B8):** Tasks B7 and B8 both failed. B8's error specifically points to an issue with string formatting in the code. The description for B7 indicates an attempt to download and resize an image.
*   **Error Messages:** The error message "not all arguments converted during string formatting" strongly suggests a problem with how variables are being used within strings.
*   **Code Snippet:** A snippet of Python code is shown within the output, likely related to the task involving web scraping. It uses libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `json`.

**In summary, the image depicts a program execution where one task succeeded while two others failed due to errors during image processing and string formatting.**image2003×745 95 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/1/c16494f34e29ae68a356211e09a264d5ba3f5846.png "image")

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the `os` library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”

I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

[Here's a caption for the image based on its content:

**"A log file showing errors in a data processing task, including file not found errors (HTTP 500) and failed attempts to read files. One task involves processing an image to extract credit card information, which results in an internal server error.

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.

Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong

[@23f2001975](/u/23f2001975) we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.

If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.

We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.

Kind regards

[The image shows a Python traceback indicating a `KeyError: 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'`. This error occurs because the code is trying to access an environment variable named 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN' using `os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']`, but that environment variable is not set.  The traceback points to line 30 of the file `/app/app.py`.image633×197 4.25 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/a/ea516be0e1c56eed1350af31ea0a2546b58528a6.png "image")

This is a screenshot of my docker log file. This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as I’ve put a lot of effort into this.

Thank you

@cartlon Same issue.

My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Can you please rerun the image on ARM based

You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page.

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.

Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.

If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:
    
    
    {
    "detail": "'choices'"
    }
    

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?

Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.

[The image shows error messages related to a task involving installing `uv` and running a script to format a file named `/data/format.md`. The first error is an "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error" when trying to install `uv` and run the script. Then, there are errors stating "Cannot read /data/format.md" and "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" when trying to access this file. A later attempt to format `/data/format.md` with `prettier@3.4.2` also resulted in an "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error", and the same "Cannot read" and "404 Not Found" errors reappear. These errors indicate issues with either the file not existing or the server experiencing problems processing the requests.Screenshot 2025-03-29 1033271511×749 29 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/6/168fb0afeb8b965e92d70295ca00374c5179d6d9.png "Screenshot 2025-03-29 103327")

I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don’t know where I have went wrong.

Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) !

I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!

Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.

Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.

Line number 81 of your app.py

`subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)`

which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.

These are the detailed point wise concerns :

  1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.

  2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.

  3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.

  4. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.




I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.

Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.

I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

Thanks and Regards

How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs. I request to check into it and provide us our marks and logs.  
Thank You.

Hi [@23f2002400](/u/23f2002400)

Check your Dockerfile if it copies tasksA.py file to docker container.  
If it does where does it copy, these are possible mistakes. You were expected to test docker images.

---
**Jivraj**  
*2025-03-29T09:09:48.134Z*


That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues.

Just look at docker_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

[Here are a few captions for the image:

**Short and descriptive:**

*   Docker image management interface showing image details like digest, tags, size, and push/pull times.

**More informative:**

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.

I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
My docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.  


[Here are the bounding box detections:
```json
[
  {"box_2d": [29, 26, 345, 733], "label": "code"},
  {"box_2d": [425, 26, 920, 906], "label": "code"},
  {"box_2d": [946, 26, 998, 999], "label": "info"}
]

The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?  


[Here are a few possible captions for the image, focusing on different aspects:

**Short & Simple:**

*   A list of function names.
*   OCR output of code snippets.

**More Descriptive:**

*   A Python code showing function names related to various tasks such as formatting markdown, handling dates, contacts, logs, documents, emails, and images.
*   Functions related to data processing, including text formatting, date extraction, contact management, and image handling.

**Technical:**

*   A set of Python function signatures, likely for data processing or automation.
*   OCR output depicting function names, possibly for a task involving various data types and formats.

**I would need to know the context of the image to provide a more appropriate caption.** For example, is it part of a tutorial, a code review, or a documentation page?image302×252 3.45 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/8/681a3a02c951eaf7014d116d45b9ac35b8fdd2de.png "image")

  
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.

So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .

Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.

Thank you

When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.

In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.

But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.

We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between `pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (`pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3`) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (`santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest`). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton), I checked my Docker log file now and realised I missed to push a couple of files to the image. Is there anything I could do now? I have all the required files in my Git repo though. Please help.

Hi,

For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.

For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK
    
    
    ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
    INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    
    

Similarly for task B2.
    
    
    INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
    ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
    INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.

For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?  
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build
    
    
    ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
     ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
    
    ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
     ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}
    

This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..

So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues..

Checkin url: [Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub](https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25/commit/a71e3a84b284d7621f2a769308340454ebd58583)

Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help

I noticed that the log mentioned:

However, my main file was named run.py, which might have caused the issue. Since the code was present, I was given a 0. Would it be possible to run it again or consider partial marks for the submission?

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe_open function that will throw a HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?

Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this

Your dockerfile is misspelt.

*2025-03-31T21:01:01.155Z*


Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.

However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.

Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.

The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.

But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.

Kind regards

Respected Team,  
I received an email stating I failed to fulfil prerequisite and scored 0 because of it.  


[The image shows the prerequisite evaluation for a project, with the following results: Docker image in Docker Hub and public: FAIL, GitHub repo present and public: PASS, Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo: PASS, MIT license present at root of GitHub repo: PASS.

Sir, I have the image in the docker and it is upload last month and it is public. So why have I received a message saying that the image is not available in the hub. Can you confirm and reevaluate the error.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal) ,

The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. `/jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3` docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.

[Here are the bounding box detections:

Hi [@24ds2000125](/u/24ds2000125)

You didn’t meet the standard naming convention for mit license naming. Name should be LICENSE(all caps) or LICENSE.md.  
check this out.

The task B6 was  
<https://quotes.toscrape.com/> has quotes from famous people.  
The .author class has the quote author’s name.  
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.  
E.g. `["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]`

The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.

Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.

These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

Kind regards

**Humorous (if appropriate for the context):**

*   "My code is so good, it even comes with its own license!" (GitHub view of a project repo)

**To choose the best caption, consider:**

*   **The context:** Where will this image be used? (e.g., a technical blog, a social media post)

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Carlton](/u/carlton) I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.

_**However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.**_

[A list of documentation files, with links to Google Drive for the Evaluation and Docker log files. The remaining items 3 to 7 are attachments. The items are: Evaluation log file, Docker log file, Server start log file, Evaluation script file, Data generation file, Docker orchestration file, and Solution script. The document also notes the Docker image ID that was evaluated.image1272×395 25.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/a/9acc2fc47ea84b9e26c1ed21442ba873d0dca20e.png "image")

But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*

  * Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).
  * Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
  * Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
  * Adding useful API endpoints, including an **`/api/`** multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing **`/read`** and **`/run`** endpoints from Project 1, plus a **`/clear`** endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
  * **Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP** , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.



All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like **hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents** , and it would do that for you—without **ever** declining the request. I like to think of it as a **terminal version of** [OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent](https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/).

* * *

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project **naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)** and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.

## To clarify, **all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29** , **after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.** Furthermore, we were **never informed** that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.

My only request is that if my **updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated** due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my **original P1 eval score could be reinstated** instead of receiving a **0** —since it was already evaluated and graded.

Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

Hi [@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine) [@22f3002723](/u/22f3002723)

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.

We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.

This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases

Hi [@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine)  
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.

[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.

Hi [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)

Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.

We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.

We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.

[The image shows error messages from a process trying to format a file named `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`.

Next, a GET request to `http://localhost:8365/read` to access the file also fails with a `400 BAD REQUEST`, and the system is unable to read the file, leading to the "A2 FAILED" message.

Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key.

We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.

We discussed it internally with [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it **regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not** on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.

In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.

I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.

Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.

Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

[Here are a few possible captions for the image:

**Short and descriptive:**

*   Email showing failed prerequisite checks for a project submission.

**More informative:**

*   Screenshot of an email titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores," detailing failed GitHub repository and licensing checks, resulting in a "FAIL" on prerequisites.

**Focused on the negative outcome:**

*   An email illustrating a frustrating outcome: failed project prerequisites due to issues with the GitHub repository and MIT license.

**A bit humorous/sarcastic (use with caution):**

*   "Dear Learner, you have failed... all the prerequisites!" Email detailing issues with a project submission.

The best caption for you depends on the context where you're using it.Screenshot 2025-04-01 0206181335×667 57.9 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/1/c15a5d064b9f2bc82a892ef7da1228f031feb29b.png "Screenshot 2025-04-01 020618")

Same for me sir, i had everything correct still its showing:- Is Docker image present in dockerhub

According to the evaluation, the Docker image is present and public, but the GitHub repository is not present and public, and neither the Dockerfile nor the MIT license are present in the root of the GitHub repo.

Hi Prashant,

Kind regards

Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.  
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.

[Here are a few options for captioning the image:

**Short and Informative:**

*   Email notification regarding basic sanity checks for submissions, including GitHub repo, MIT license, DockerFile, and Docker image accessibility.
*   Important email from TDS team at IITM regarding submission sanity checks and the risk of scoring 0 marks if issues aren't addressed.

**More Detailed:**

*   Email regarding submission sanity checks from the TDS team at IITM. The email details that submissions need to have a public GitHub repo, an MIT license, a DockerFile, and an accessible Docker image. Project 1 submissions are at risk of scoring zero if the checks are not met.
*   A reminder email from TDS team to check submissions for basic sanity, including checking for a public GitHub repo, MIT license, DockerFile, and an accessible Docker image. The email indicates that a significant number of submissions have failed these checks and risk scoring 0 marks.

**Emphasizing the Potential Issue:**

*   Warning email: Submissions for [TDS Jan 2025] face the risk of scoring 0 marks if basic sanity checks (GitHub repo, MIT license, DockerFile, Docker image) are not met.
*   Urgent email from IITM! Your submission might score 0 marks due to sanity check failures. Please check your submission against requirements for a public GitHub repo, MIT license, DockerFile, and accessible Docker image.

I think the best option depends on the specific context where you're using the caption. Choose the one that best highlights the key information you want to convey.Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 12.28.22 PM2236×912 208 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/d/ad091bfbf1e7642fa941a72ce2d527fac1e26dd8.png "Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 12.28.22 PM")

There's a prompt to add a README file, and the repository's languages are Python (98.0%) and Dockerfile (2.0%). The "About" section is empty, with a mention of MIT license, activity, zero stars, one watcher, and zero forks. There are no releases or packages published yet. The suggested workflow is a Python package.Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.44.24 AM3324×1794 497 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/c/0ce93452fedd6a15660a312186ed7f3b3a10a39e.png "Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.44.24 AM")

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?

After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.

This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working application but not a working container.

[Here are the bounding box detections:

You only copied `app.py` into your docker image.

How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?

Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

Kind regards

[@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine)

Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. 

_However_ with regards to your long post…

Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a _very_ experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.

What you have done is what is called in industry as **gold plating**. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.

In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

  1. Because it does not deliver what was required,
  2. Wastes valuable time and resources
  3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
  4. Complicates testing
  5. Leads to scope creep



His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.

I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.

For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

Kindest regards

Hi Sir,  
I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is **4db729a03f74** , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.  
I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your positive response.

Hi Abhay,

This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.

Kind regards

Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, [@carlton](/u/carlton). It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.

Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible **within the scope of the problem statement**.

What began as just another (pun intended) _tedious_ assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. 

_(…caution: long post ahead)_

I noticed that **test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use**. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the **inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads**. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.

Some might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.

**Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers** : merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.

At the core of it, it’s all about **how much flexibility vs rigidity** we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.

Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

  * Reason about the task, understand intent,
  * Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. _design_ a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
  * Execute those workflows (_walk_ the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
  * Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.



Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in [this ICLR 2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.

To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of **general-purpose tools** :

  * A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
  * A Python script runner
  * A Shell executor



With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.

As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was **emergent behavior** , not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. _Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!_

I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.

PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: **thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design**. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. 

* * *

**TL;DR**  
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

Kind regards

I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.  
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.  
Thank you.

Respected Sir,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.

According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.

Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

[@carlton](/u/carlton) i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term  
I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did  
Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.

Hi Hari,

I just _manually_ checked your repo.

[The image shows a GitHub 404 error page, with the text "This is not the web page you are looking for," and the URL is "https://github.com/harrypandey829/tds_llm_automation-agent".

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir When I submitted project 1, I was passing part A with 8/10 marks but today it is showing 0 marks on my email, but when I run it just now it is showing 4/10 on my vs code.  
Whereas when I download the file from GitHub and run it, it is showing 1/10 now.

[Here's a caption for the image:

**A Python script in VS Code encounters a failed task, highlighted in red. The task (A10) involves querying a SQLite database for "Gold" tickets and calculating total sales. The "Expected" and "Result" outputs differ, indicating an error.**image1897×965 112 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/d/9d7495b7d3d112adfac7d592ee6e9024351dc618.png "image")

  


[Here are a few caption options for the image:

**Short and descriptive:**

*   Debugging Python code with a failed test case.
*   A programmer working on a FastAPI application with tasks.

**More informative:**

*   A development environment showing a Python FastAPI project with failing tests, indicating a discrepancy between the expected and actual results for a task related to ticket sales data.
*   Screenshot of a coding environment, showing a failed test case in a Python FastAPI project related to a SQLite database and ticket sales calculations.

**Humorous/relatable:**

*   The classic "works on my machine" situation.
*   Debugging: the fun part of coding (said no one ever).
*   When the expected and actual results have very different opinions.

I can generate more options if you like.WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 17.28.47_927a687b1600×1200 181 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/f/3fe91b246d5e0f0bf26245d8b4d0ab0d074827f5.jpeg "WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 17.28.47_927a687b")

To replicate the test environment:

Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.

Pass the required arguments to the above application and it will find the latest commit before the 18th, fetch it and unzip it to the folder you specified. Please use the appropriate arguments as specified in the application.

`docker build -t <your image name> .`

Run new docker image using  
`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 <your image name>`

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder  
`uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was tested.  
You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

These instructions are same for everyone. So check first before posting here.

All the files are in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt ):  
1)
    
    
    Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):
    
    docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1
    

**OR**  
2)
    
    
    Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:
    
    docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .
    

_Both the things work for me_()

    docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=i.am.still.noob.inTDS -p 8000:8000 tushar2k5/tds-project-1

Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files in the repo please consider it)[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

[The image shows the output of a program or test run. It indicates a failure related to reading a file "c5.txt" with a 404 error and a corresponding "C5 failed" message. The score is 7 out of 25. The program is also making a POST request to an OpenAI embeddings API endpoint and it is working as expected.

Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

Sir, could you please fetch my latest GitHub commit before 18th Feb and build the image through that one?  
I received a mail saying that the Docker image is not accessible, but it is already there. Kindly request you to evaluate my submission.

Hi [@Abhay222](/u/abhay222)

Docker image submitted by you doesn’t exists.

[Here are a few captions for the image:

**Simple Captions:**

*   "Docker Hub 404 Error."
*   "Oops! Page not found on Docker Hub."
*   "Missing Docker image on Docker Hub."

**Descriptive Captions:**

*   "A Docker Hub page returning a 404 error, indicating the requested resource for user 'abhay227' and version 'version1' could not be found."
*   "The image shows a 404 error on Docker Hub. The user 'abhay227' attempted to access a repository tagged 'version1' but the page was not found."
*   "Encountered a 'Page Not Found' error while browsing Docker Hub. The error references the URL associated with user 'abhay227' and version 'version1'."

**Humorous Captions:**

*   "Docker Hub: Where images go to hide. 404 Error."
*   "Houston, we have a problem. Docker image missing."

Hi [@23f1000879](/u/23f1000879)

This basically tells you didn’t validate docker Dockerfile and docker image by building and running them, otherwise you would have corrected the mistake.

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”

If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?

We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Dear Sir,  
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.  
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is  
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”] has an **invisible Unicode non-breaking space** (`U+00A0`) between `"run", "app.py"` instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.  
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE. Expecting a positive response from your end.

[Here are a few caption options for the image:

**Short and to the point:**

*   Evaluation log filled with errors. Ouch.

**More descriptive:**

*   A failed evaluation log showing issues with file handling, string formatting, and connection errors. Definitely needs debugging.

**A bit more humorous:**

*   This evaluation log looks like a crime scene. Looks like it needs a rescue.

**Which caption is best depends on the context where you are sharing the image.**image1895×938 90 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/6/6689843088265aa67624484279c35e788ed5d74c.png "image")

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag `"abhay227/version1"` instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is `4db729a03f74`, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available.  
Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available.

Could you rerun the test ?

Respected Sir,

Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.  
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment  
I cloned my repository using:
    
    
    bash
    git clone <my_repo_url>
    cd <my_repo_directory>
    I built the Docker image using:
    
    bash
    docker build -t.
    I ran the Docker container with:
    
    bash
    docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
    
    I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.
    
    Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:
    
    bash

Issue with Original Submission  
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.

However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.  
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.

Action Taken  
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:

The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.

It responds to requests within the required timeframe.

I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:  
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest

Request for Re-Evaluation  
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.

Previous Message for Reference  
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:

"Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

 [Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that import requests import pandas DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata") url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits" try : response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60) fetch_commit = None if response.status_code == 200: commits = response.json() for commit in commits: sha = commit["sha"] … 

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.  
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.

Kind regards

You can take it up with [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
I did not come up with the standard.  
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

> Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

Kindest regards.

Respected Sir,  
see the above image its from the scores we got from mail just before the latest one, in that I had got 7/20 and now new mail shows I got 0?? how is this possible…  
the link for evaluation in which i got 7/20 is : [23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cNVy9KSfSITZg_KGLF2_wwLWjzNl8mb5/view)  


[The image shows the results of an automated check on a Github and Docker repository.

The score is as follows: Task score is 0, the Bonus is 1, and the P1 score is 1. It concludes that evaluation logs will be attached if the API service actually started working within 5 minutes, otherwise, a docker log will only be available.image1315×732 45.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/f/afbded56c295f1e2ff28878559e430ba3ed8244e.png "image")

  
MOST importantly mail shows :

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:  
We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.

but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker_logs.zip or evaluation_logs.zip that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

Hi Hari,

Your docker failed to build.

Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in

 [Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that import requests import pandas DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata") url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits" try : response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60) fetch_commit = None if response.status_code == 200: commits = response.json() for commit in commits: sha = commit["sha"] … 

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.  
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.

The specific error in your case is:  
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

Thats why there are no logs.  
Kind regards

Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup.

What’s the take away for everyone? Let’s move on. This isn’t the end.

What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.

Most common reason for during running docker image was `taskA module was missing` which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.

**Jivraj**

This is error that you got while building docker image using docker file in your github repo tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

In your Dockerfile you are trying to copy requirements.txt but it doesn’t exists in the directory where Dockerfile is located

Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically  
when:  
`uv run app.py` is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).  
my dockerfile from the repo:
    
    
    FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm
    
    # Install dependencies
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates
    
    # Download and install uv
    ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
    RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh
    
    # Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
    RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow
    
    # Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
    ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"
    
    # Set up the application directory
    WORKDIR /app
    # Copy application files
    COPY *.py /app/
    COPY .env /app/
    
    # Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
    CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]
    

here u can see it installs using pip install …

here it’s requiring `.env` file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had `.env` file for AIPROXY_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that `.env` file but as git doesn’t allow upload of `.env` file I couldn’t upload`.env` to git

the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because`.env` file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the `.env` file so it didn’t build so I had to create the `.env` file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the `.env` file(it supports both`.env` file and environment variable one)

I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image.  
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks.

We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.

Dear Sir,  
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.

Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.

With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

Hi [@23f1001524](/u/23f1001524) [@afsalshah](/u/afsalshah) [@23f1000879](/u/23f1000879) [@23f1002056](/u/23f1002056)

I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.

We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.

**A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.**

**Critical failures prevents everything else from working** and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.

I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

Kindest regards

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) ,

I couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites. I also tried reproducing the test environment and scored 9/25 (screenshot attached below).  


[The image shows a terminal output with error messages and HTTP requests. A GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error, and the system couldn't read the file `/data/c5.txt`, causing the C5 task to fail. The score is 9 out of 25. A POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` was successful, returning a 200 OK status.image1124×268 9.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/d/fd1e9ebbdaabe4f7e853a25f71f645bd06fd0f01.png "image")

Would really appreciate it if you could take a look. Thanks in advance!

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand),

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.

I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.

I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.

I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

[The image shows an error log related to a task involving a 'datasette' server and a SQLite database named 'ticket-sales.db'. The task attempts to count the number of rows in a 'tickets' table where the 'type' column is "Bronze" and save the result to a CSV file named 'b10.csv'. The log indicates several issues:

1.  The task failed (indicated by "89 FAILED").
2.  There's an "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error," potentially indicating a problem with the 'datasette' server or the provided SQL query.
3.  A subsequent attempt to read the 'b10.csv' file results in an "HTTP 404 Not Found" error, suggesting the file was either not created or not saved correctly.
4.  Finally, the log confirms that "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv," further indicating the failure to process the data as intended.

In summary, the task encounters errors while trying to query a SQLite database, save the results, and subsequently read the saved data, leading to the overall failure.WhatsApp Image 2025-04-07 at 15.37.17_fb28b652720×1600 139 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/b/4bbeee344dad6a24766c6978889ccd69086dcc6d.jpeg "WhatsApp Image 2025-04-07 at 15.37.17_fb28b652")

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand i…

Dear [@carlton](/u/carlton)

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the  
`/app/app/main.py` file is missing. However, in my project directory, the  
`main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.

To run the project, the command I used is:
    
    
    python run.py
    

Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py`.

I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-agent`).

For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Here is the GitHub link to my project:

Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.  
The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.  
Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated.  
Thankyou

This `npx` error is originating from your Docker container—it’s not being generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.

My code uses `npx` to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via `subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])`, which assumes that `npx` is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or `npx`, this results in an error during evaluation.

To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:

bash:` apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

Once installed, `npx prettier@3.4.2` should work as expected.

For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where `npx` is available by default.

Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required.  
But, when you gus evaluated , I get the following error:docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: “uvicorn”: executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.  
Could you please help me understand why this is happening even though the evaluation script ran fine?

Dear Sirs,  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.

[Here are the instructions for a Docker project:

1.  Create a Dockerfile to build the application.
2.  Publish the Docker image publicly to Docker Hub.
3.  Ensure the image runs via the command: `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. This should automatically serve the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`.
4.  Submit the GitHub repository URL (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and the Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`) in a Google Form.Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513805×197 9.52 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/b/7b8a704d618edd74036a95649a83054e29932879.png "Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513")

**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent)  
**Docker repo submitted:** wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent

The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the `app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.

I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the `app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:  
[https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/blob/main/app/app.py).  
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: <https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent>.

Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.

I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Thank You and Regards,

24ds3000090

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.

[The code fails to find the specified fonts for image generation, resulting in an "OSError: cannot open resource" error. It attempts to use both "arial.ttf" and "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf", but neither can be located, indicating a potential font installation or path issue.image1298×857 29.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a49f182e22015df35039be85cdd26ad71a07f7a3.png "image")

I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.  


[Here's a caption for the image:

**A Python script showcasing the use of argparse for argument parsing, directory creation using os.makedirs, and calls to several functions (a2_format_markdown, a3_dates, etc.).  The script also includes a disclaimer indicating it's a guide and subject to change before evaluation.**image1027×510 11 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f99c9908823f381a7756ba6fe89d4827ca2faf4.png "image")

  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Hi,

Please let me know the reason on why I have not got any bonus marks.

[Here's a caption for the image:

"The image displays the grading details for a project, including the GitHub and Docker repository submissions, a prerequisite check showing pass or fail criteria, and individual scores for tasks, bonus, and P1. The final score calculation is based on the minimum value between 20 and the sum of task score and bonus."image1310×681 14.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a4b4614f55f231153c89c3de51b0c0ae60d44633.png "image")

**Focusing on the codebase:**

*   Inside the "project1_final" GitHub repository, showing the files and folders, and the history of updates.

**Humorous (if appropriate for the context):**

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

Respected Sir,

  * Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
  * when we download the repository it doesn’t have the `.env` file,
  * for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
  * after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
  * As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`…you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
  * after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
  * just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable



and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:
    
    
    git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git
    

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` with new ones according to test environment
    
    
    docker build -t llm-agent .
    
    
    
    docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
    or
    docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
    

and in another terminal
    
    
    uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

Respected sir  
I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma.  
Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

I tested the docker file in docker playground again.. Please find the screenshot of the docker build command and the log output of the docker build.. It went thru without issues..

Was the latest docker file used from git lab? Because as explained on March 30 i had to remove the hardcoded http/https proxies of my office environment,

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url’s set as http_proxy and https_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

**Subject:** Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir,  
Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS** , it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is _linux/amd64_ (64-bit **x86**). I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**  
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1  
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0  


[Here are a few captions for the image:

**Short and descriptive:**

*   GitHub repository "task\_agent\_api" showing files and recent commits.

**More informative:**

*   A snapshot of the file structure and commit history for the "task\_agent\_api" project on GitHub, highlighting files like "dockerfile," "app.py," and "requirements.txt".

**If focusing on a specific element:**

*   The "dockerfile" in the "task\_agent\_api" GitHub repository, updated 2 months ago.
*   The "task\_agent\_api" repository on GitHub, showing 4 commits, the MIT license, and 1 watcher.

Hi Hilal,

You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post

 [Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv. # /// script # dependencies = [ # "requests", # ] # /// import requests import datetime as dt import zoneinfo import argparse import os import zipfile parser = argparse.… 

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.

The specific error itself means:  
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.

If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

Kind regards

Hi Jayaram,

Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.

We are considering latest submission which have docker repo `maheshsingh01/tdsrepos `  
which is not accessible publically.  


[Here are a few captions for the image:

**Short and to the point:**

*   Docker Hub 404 error.
*   Oops, page not found on Docker Hub.

**More descriptive:**

*   A 404 error on Docker Hub, indicating a missing repository or tag.
*   Frustration! Docker Hub is showing a "page not found" error.

**Humorous:**

*   Looks like someone's Docker image vanished into thin air! 404 error.
*   Even Docker Hub has its bad days. 404 error.

I think the best caption is:  **A 404 error on Docker Hub, indicating a missing repository or tag.**image1866×949 92.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/7/174c8e4e8ad4c6e537203447df3d370b0efa8782.png "image")

Good evening!

I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation.

The docker image which I share is working at my end. The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra level restrictions.

I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it.

Thanks,

Thank you!

*   Notification about P1 submission evaluation changes, Dockerfile search, and coding standards.

**More Detailed:**

*   Email update on a course assignment (P1) where the requirement for the Dockerfile location has been relaxed. Submissions will be evaluated separately at the end of the term, and no changes to the GitHub repo after Feb 18th will be considered. Strict spelling is required for the necessary files.
*   An email from Carlton D'Silva to learners, informing them about a change in the P1 assignment requirements. The location of the Dockerfile is no longer strict, but submissions will only be evaluated at the end of the term, and no changes to the repo after Feb 18th. Spelling is still critical.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Respected Sir,

I hope you are doing well.  
This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term  
I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‘D’).

While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.

I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.  
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.  
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
S. Sharmile

Hi Everyone,

We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.
