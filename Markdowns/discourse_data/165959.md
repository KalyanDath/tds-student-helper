Please post any questions related to [Graded Assignment 4 - Data Sourcing](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga4).

Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code (rather than screenshots). It’s easier for us to copy-paste and test.

[The image shows a JSON data snippet representing a movie with its ID, title, year, and rating, along with an error message indicating that a test case expected a rating of 2.9 but received an actual rating of 2.9.Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301331×314 12.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/0/0007976ca3410205e4fa403a71b9a1ac79bf5192.png "Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301")

    Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4
    

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?

edit: This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

**JoelJeffrey**

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?




---
**s.anand**  
*2025-02-04T06:15:20.501Z*


[@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)  
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error

As per instruction we need to create a directory in that we should have .yml file. But I tried with there were two issues (1) Github has not allowed to run the file (as there was no menu is available to run manually) (I checked with Copolit AI it says it is not correct to have cron jobs in a directory, I am not sure) (2) when I submit the url to iitm I got the following error  


[The image shows an error message "YAMLParseError: Implicit keys need to be on a single line at line 1, column 1: <!DOCTYPE html>" associated with a GitHub repository URL that includes "workflows," suggesting a problem with the YAML configuration of a GitHub Actions workflow.image602×135 24.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/f/6fd287b966b7a580fabd12762ac0e6592b0190b5.png "image")

  
I removed the directory and submitted the same url I got the following error

Hi Tushar,

If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

In ques 4 Scrap the BBC Weather API,  
I scraped the locationId for my city (i.e Mumbai)

and post that also mapped each `issueDate` to its corresponding `enhancedWeatherDescription` .

The sample output mentioned was:  
The output would look like this:
    
    
    {
      "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
      "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
      "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
      // ... additional days
    }
    

And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC weather was)

{  
“2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

Issue resolved for me after following below step  
After creating the workflow:

  * Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete
  * Ensure it appears as the **most recent action** in your repository
  * Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time.

I have tried these steps:
    
    
    import pymupdf4llm
    md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")
    
    import pathlib
    pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())
    

Then i run this in bash
    
    
    prettier --write output.md
    

And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf.

#Can someone please advise me a better approach?

try manually inspecting the output of the api and compare it with your script output.  
Or else try refreshing the browser and check.

Q4 BBC Weather

I don’t understand why I am getting

> Error: At root: Different number of properties

Is it because of different dates? Shall I match the dates?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Please guide. Thank you.

[The image shows a coding exercise where the task is to transform weather data from the BBC Weather API, specifically extracting the issue date and weather description, with an example of the desired JSON format, and the user's attempt at providing the weather forecast description for Osaka resulting in an error due to a different number of properties than expected.BBC weather565×781 30.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/7/e7c12cee82eccb262d1c2752a98e95c3c3a94457.png "BBC weather")

On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now.

Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like Missing links, Missing tables…

But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors?

I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.

Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

1. There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.  
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as link texts same as in pdf.



Link text

Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,  
below error is still observed.

Error: Missing links

Did anyone else face same issue ?

  2. Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.  
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.



Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.

[@21F1005510](/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also known as Graymail in India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas). My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.

**Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?** Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

This is the only thing which worked for me.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB. The current example on the portal is:

Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.

I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?

In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.  
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.

For the particular instance - `“2024–”`, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.

That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.

But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.

[The image shows a JSON-formatted list of TV shows or movies with their IDs, titles, years, and ratings, but it includes an error message indicating a mismatch between expected and actual values in the "title" field, specifically for the record that should have "12.

you have to manually change for a few mismatch.

 s.anand:

> [@21F1005510](/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also known as Graymail in India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas). My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.

> **Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?** Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.  
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:  
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00  
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00  
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.

Please help with the second issue.

  1. For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.  
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.



> Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.

  2. I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer.

first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors

yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.

but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.

But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this.

We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course.

And i have never seen any course cool as this,

  * like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (_and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom , gave client side answer checks’s code to `o1` and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this_)
  * keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.  
( _i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem_)

if you look closely the expected value is `2024- ` and actual that you are supplying is `2024`.  
Difference ? your value does have a `-` and a space at the end.  
reason ? you might be scraping it ? `trim()` or maybe using `innerText` to get tag’s text ?

Beyond the specific tools mentioned (like `IMPORTHTML` in Google Sheets or `httpx` and `lxml` in Python), what are the broader _ethical considerations_ when scraping data from websites, and how can developers ensure they are acting responsibly and respecting website owners’ rights and resources?

You just have to add a space after a hyphen




---
**Saransh_Saini**  
*2025-02-09T17:46:11.087Z*


Check if you are using table formating where there is a table, also there is perhaps a code block in the pdf where a small section of text is in different font than the rest.




---
**21f3000745**  
*2025-02-09T17:49:43.501Z*

[A student is seeking help in a data sourcing discussion thread after encountering a "location_id" not defined error while running code, likely related to fetching weather data for Nur-Sultan from the BBC weather website.image1880×873 141 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/4/d4d9c422431c2ca2a06ac2ac397ddf40ca620253.png "image")

  
As you can see in this screen shot i already tried this question and getting error so i posted it on discourse. But still i did not get any marks for attempting this question.

Hello [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir,  
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly.

Hoping for a positive response.  
Thanks & Regards

[In a GA4 data sourcing discussion forum from January 2025, a user named Carlton, identified as a Course TA, addresses students @2313002537, @21f3000745, and @Jeleshiya, stating that anyone who received the Nur-Sultan parameter for a particular question and attempted it will receive a mark.image1900×860 118 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/e/5ebde997ebbaa1a9814e6e79b23821f118c198c2.png "image")

if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look like in the dashboard?

I don’t think it is added in my case.

It will show up as 110 marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon.

Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I understand that each set of students get different questions. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)
